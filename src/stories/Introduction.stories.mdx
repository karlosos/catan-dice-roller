# Directory Structure

I am using [**atomic design**](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) to categorize components into following categories: (1) atoms, (2) molecules, (3) organisms, (4) templates, (5) pages.

Storybook recommends building UIs with a [**component-driven**](https://componentdriven.org) process starting with atomic components and ending with pages.
